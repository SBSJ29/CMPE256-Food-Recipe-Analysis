# CMPE256-Food-Recipe-Analysis
Our project was a food recipe recommendation system based off of the Food.com recipe and reviews dataset. Our group developed both content-based and collaborative filtering based recommendation systems to accomplish these tasks.
We even attempted to create a hybrid content-based and collaborative filtering based recommendation system by combining our content-based approach with a user-based collaborative filtering approach.
